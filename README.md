# Airport
 
Make sure you open the program from both the client(Wpf) and Server(asp.net core).

Check the Startup.cs, if you have your database ready with airports already use PlaneMaker.Load, If you dont have airports in the database use PlaneMaker.CreadAndLoad 
But MAKE SURE next time you open the program its on PlaneMaker.Load Mode!!!!!
